# this in a short-lived container of the current image, next to each release
# install. The hooks live here rather than in a release because agents keep
# their path for as long as they run, and an old release gets deleted. With the
# gateway's settings gone the hooks stay in place and do nothing, so running
# agents are unharmed.
